I believe in beauty and art. I believe that there are some things that transcend <a id="borders" href="#">borders <video autoplay muted width="1000" height="800" 
name="desert" src="photos/desert.mov"></video>
     </a> and the boundaries we put up. And through art and language we can all speak to one another in line, shapes and curves. Coming from the <a id="works" href="#">Middle East<img src="photos/me.jpg"></a>, people are divided in how they embrace there culture with some clutching it close to there chest and others holding it at a distance. Personally I was undecided on how to approach myself until New York and all my work seems to be speaking of
 <a id="about" href="#">home<img src="photos/desert.jpg"></a> on some personal level. Hopefully through my pieces you can all get a sense of where I come <a id="from" href="#">from <video autoplay muted width="800" height="600" 
name="mettai" src="photos/mettai.mov"></video>
</a> and the people who have grown with me and maybe that will change the way you look at us.
