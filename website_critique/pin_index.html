<article>While I do love pinterest I intensely dislike the way it looks and functions. Everything is placed in these boxes that have rounded corners and the text is set in these boxes as well. Even the scroll bar and font have the same aesthetic. Its a very practical website but lacks attraction in all areas. The entire website needs to be redesigned since this seems like it was made in 2005 and not 2015 onwards. It needs to be rebranded and carry another tone to it rather than this cutesy/boring thing that carries no weight or interest.<div>
