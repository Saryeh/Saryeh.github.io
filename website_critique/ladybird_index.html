<article>The website is really fluid in how it transitions from one page to the next. Also the layout is tied together with this effect on the background that creates a grain and reinfroces the fact that this is a website about a movie. The links are creative like the vector image, which takes you to the next page. Its really creative how he appraoched the movie making it a quiz where rather than scrolling through videos and selceting, your given a deck of cards to take or leave, then shown a clip. Animations make it interactive and fun. Ive seen the movie and this website really reflects the tone of it with this childish way of appraoching the subject as a deck of cards. There is alot of humor reflecting the characters way of thought with the opening page of the cross and raven ontop of it showing how she views where shes from or the display font on the opening page of "Lady Bird", which is how she percieves herself. The designer made the website reflect the character and her age group in a way that is really playful.<div>
